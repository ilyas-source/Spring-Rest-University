## University

This is my biggest project, my playground, place where I put my hands on all new technologies. Application is being sequentially transformed to use all relevant Spring-related frameworks and even has a front-end.

All under strict code review from my mentor, who keeps me out from writing non-productional quality code.

## Task progression

- [x] Make a research and describe university structure

- [x] Create a JAVA project based on the University UML class diagram. Create models implementation

- [x] Create Spring JDBC based DAO for your application.

- [x] Create a service layer and implement business logic. You should use Spring IoC.

- [x] Add custom exceptions and logging.

- [x] Create status pages (read data from DB - show it in HTML).

- [x] Create full CRUD pages for models. The main feature of the application is Class Timetable for students and teachers. Students or teachers can get their timetable for a day or for a month.

- [x] Create DataSource in web-project configuration files. Switch DAO layer to lookup DataSource by JNDI name.

- [x] Rewrite the DAO layer. Use Hibernate instead of Spring JDBC.

- [x] Spring Boot

- [x] Spring Data JPA

- [x] Validation

- [x] REST

- [x] Swagger
